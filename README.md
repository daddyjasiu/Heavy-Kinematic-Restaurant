# Heavy-Kinematic-Restaurant
Restaurant app that allows users to order food and sends email with their order.

App lets user add any number of foods (pizza, main courses, soups and drinks) to shopping cart with toppings and extras of their choice.

Then, it makes it possible for them to leave a message to their order. 

Finally, upon placing an order, an email is sent to the ordering user with their full order and message (if there was one).

User can then check out their recent orders in orders' history.
